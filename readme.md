## Example of how to call/invoke your API, and a description of what data comes back. 
     * Use axios within my controllers to make the API call (use string interpolation to add parameters to URL)
     * The JSON data that is returned for the cocktail by name includes drink id, drink name, type of glass, if it's alcoholic or non, instructions, ingredients, measurements, and a .jpg of the drink.
     * The JSON that is returned for search by ingredient includes the ingredient id, name, description, type, if it's alcoholic or non, and the ABV
## MVP Goals
     * Users can search for drinks by name or by ingredient
     * Once they have signed up, allow users to add/delete drinks to their list of favorites
     * Once they have signed up, allow users to add/delete ingredients to their bar and access recipes for each ingredient from their bar list
     * Allow users to click on any drink name to view the full recipe
     * Start of styling
## Stretch goals
     * Allow logged in users to rate their saved drinks
     * Allow logged in users to add/delete drinks to a "try it" list
     * Better styling
## Any potential roadblocks?
     * I don't fully understand all of this yet ðŸ˜…
